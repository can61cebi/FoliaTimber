  <strong>Smart tree chopping with intelligent structure protection for Folia & Paper</strong>
</p>

---

**Finally, a tree feller that doesn't break your house.**

FoliaTimber is a lightweight, high-performance plugin built for **Folia** and **Paper** 1.21+. It lets you chop down entire trees by breaking just one log, but with a smart twist: it knows when you're hitting a tree and when you're hitting a building.

---

## ✨ Highlights

- ⚡ **Chop in one hit:** Break the bottom log, take the whole tree.
- 🏠 **Smart Protection:** Automatically ignores player builds, villager houses, and treehouses.
- 📦 **No Item Lag:** Logs and leaves go directly into your inventory.
- 🪓 **Save your Axe:** Only spends durability on the wood, not the leaves.
- 🛡️ **Pro Protection:** Works with **CoreProtect** and **WorldGuard**.
- 🌍 **Native Languages:** English, Turkish, and German support.
- 🐞 **Live Debug:** Use `/timber debug` to see exactly how the plugin "sees" the tree.
