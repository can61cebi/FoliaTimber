# FoliaTimber 🪓

**Finally, a tree feller that doesn't break your house.**

FoliaTimber lets you chop entire trees by breaking a single log, while your builds stay safe. Built natively for high-performance servers running **Folia** (1.21.11+).

---

## ✨ Highlights

- ⚡ **Chop in one hit:** Break the bottom log, take the whole tree.
- 🏠 **Smart Protection:** Automatically ignores player builds, villager houses, and treehouses.
- 📦 **No Item Lag:** Logs and leaves go directly into your inventory.
- 🪓 **Save your Axe:** Only spends durability on the wood, not the leaves.
- 🛡️ **Pro Protection:** Works with **CoreProtect** and **WorldGuard**.
- 🌍 **Native Languages:** English, Turkish, and German support.
- 🐞 **Live Debug:** Use `/timber debug` to see exactly how the plugin "sees" the tree.
